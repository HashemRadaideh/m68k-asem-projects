Simple m68k assembly project, searches for a character with in a given string.

Write a 68000 assembly code that searches for a certain character in a 
null-terminated text stored in the memory and counts its occurrences in
that text.
The code should use TRAP instruction to prompt the user to enter the
character he/she wants to search for.
Then it calls a subroutine to find how many times the character occurs
in the text, and then it prints a message with the result on the screen.
The code should also give the user the choice to enter another character
if he/she wants or exit the search.
